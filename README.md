# Clear Text

clear text prints out text while removing newline characters from pdf-copied texts and reference brackets from wikipedia-copied texts

_needs python3_

## Instructions

* paste your text into a text file and place it in same directory as `main.py`
* run script for pdf as 
```
python main.py -p input.txt
```
* run script for wiki as 
```
python main.py -w input.txt
```
* output can be copied from terminal

## possible future scope

1. input is taken from clipboard *(most interesting one, will **def** try for this)*
2. output is written to a separate file
3. output is auto-copied to clipboard *(would need researching)*
